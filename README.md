# puppy

Golang web app to keep track of your puppies! üê∂

## What you'll learn

- A little bit of Go programming
- Representing data using structs
- Presenting the data in the browser using HTML templates
- Basic input validation
- Idiomatic ways to handle errors, make templates, etc. in Go

## Getting started

You need to have Go installed: https://golang.org

Run the following command:

```shell
go run main.go
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/dog/Rex. You should see a simple
page that has the dog's name at the top, followed by an edit link and then a
description of the dog.

## Now it's your turn

After exploring the code and understanding how it works (look at the commit log
too), try adding a few features.

This killer dog log may be the next big thing, but perhaps it could first use
some improvements like the ability to add a dog's photo.

Some other things to try:

- Allow dogs to be deleted
- Save the dog information to a SQLite database
- Add logging so that we know what routes are being hit, the response time, etc.
